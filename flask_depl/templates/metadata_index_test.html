        <u><h2><mark class="internal">Overview:</mark></h2></u>
        <p> Cancer is simply defined as abnormal growth of cells. Our whole body is made up of cells that act and grow in controlled ways as per the needs. <br>
            They are genetically controlled. If any of the genes in  these cells is damaged, then the cell can grow out of control thus eventually leading to cancer.<br> 
            Cancer cells quickly grow and divide. This happens even when there's no enough space for growth and also nutrients shortage .<br>
            They can spread to other parts of the body. Tumors, masses, or lesions are names for abnormal growths of cells that can become cancer.<br>
        </p>
        
        <br>

        <p>Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. The term "cancer" is used when a tumor is malignant,<br>
            which is to say it has the potential to cause harm, including death. Tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign tumors tend to grow slowly<br>
            and do not spread. Malignant tumors can grow rapidly, invade and destroy nearby normal tissues, and spread throughout the body.</p>

        <u><h2><mark class="internal">Overview:</mark></h2></u>
        <p> The term "arrhythmia" refers to any change from the normal sequence of electrical impulses of heart. The impulses be happen too fast or too slow. <br>
            causing the heart to beat abnormally. When the heart doesn't beat properly, it can't pump blood effectively..thus<br> 
            the lungs, brain and other organs can't work properly and may shut down or be damaged.<br>
            The fluctuations can be classified into five categories.<br>
        </p>
        
        <br>

        <p> <b>Atrial fibrillation</b> is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots in the heart.<br>
            <b>Bradycardia</b> is a slow heart rate. An adults at rest usually has a beat between 60 and 100 times a minute. <br>
            If one has bradycardia, the heart beats fewer than 60 times a minute.<br>
            A <b>conduction disorder</b>, also known as heart block, is a problem with the electrical system that controls one's heart rate and rhythm.<br>
            <b>Premature ventricular contractions</b>are extra heartbeats that begin in one of the heart's two lower pumping chambers (ventricles). <br>
            These extra beats disrupt the regular heart rhythm, sometimes causing a sensation of a fluttering or a skipped beat in the chest. <br>
            <b>Ventricular fibrillation</b> is a type of abnormal heart rhythm where disorganized heart signals cause the lower heart chambers (ventricles) to twitch uselessly.<br>
            As a result, the heart doesn't pump blood to the rest of the body.<br>

        <p> liver disease applies to many conditions that stop the liver from working or prevent it from functioning well. <br>
            The liver is body's largest internal organ and performs hundreds of tasks associated with food digestion, energy storage and waste filtering.<br>
            Thus, any damage made to liver builds up over time if left untreated.<br> 
            Liver disease is also called hepatic disease<br>
        </p>
        
        <br>

        <p>Most common types of liver disease include, 'Hepatitis'- defined as an inflammation of liver, <br>
            Fatty Liver Disease- defined as a condition in which too much fat builds up in your liver,<br>
            Cirrhosis- defined as the last stage of scarring (fibrosis) of liver, liver cancer.

        <u><h2><mark class="internal">Overview:</mark></h2></u>
        <p> Malaria is a protozoan infection of the red blood cells, transmitted by the bite of a female anopheles mosquito. <br>
            While widespread throughout the tropics, malaria has been virtually eliminated by  waste filtering from temperate climates.<br>
            The severity of malaria varies based on the species of plasmodium.<br> 
        </p>

        <p>
            When a mosquito bites someone who has malaria, the mosquito becomes infected.<br>
            When that mosquito bites someone else, it transfers a parasite to the other person’s bloodstream. There, the parasites multiply. <br>
            There are five types of malaria parasites that can infect humans.<br>
            In rare cases, people who are pregnant and who have malaria can transfer the disease to their children before or during birth. <br>
            It’s possible, but unlikely, for malaria to be passed through blood transfusions, organ donations and hypodermic needles.

        <p> It is a condition where your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood the way they should. <br>
            You are at greater risk for kidney disease if you have diabetes or high blood pressure.<br>
            If you experience kidney failure, treatments include kidney transplant or dialysis.<br>
        </p>
        <br>

        <p> Common types of kidneey disease include, Chronic kidney disease - a condition where kidney function will deteriorate<br>
            to the point where they can no longer properly perform their job.<br>
            Kidney stones - Minerals and other substances in your blood may crystallize in the kidneys, forming solid particles, <br>
            or stones, that usually pass out of your body in urine. <br>
            Polycystic kidney disease - It is a genetic disorder that causes many cysts, round sacs of fluid, to grow inside <br>
            and on the surfaces of your kidneys, interfering with kidney function. <br>
            Urinary tract infections - They are bacterial infections of any of the parts of your urinary system. <br>
            Infections in the bladder and urethra are most common. They’re generally easily treatable and have few, if any, long-term consequences.<br>
            However, if left untreated, these infections can spread to the kidneys and lead to kidney failure.

    <u><h2><mark class="internal">Overview:</mark></h2></u>
    <p> Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs.<br>
        The air sacs may be filled with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty<br> 
        breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Pneumonia can be classified into four types - Bacterial pneumonia, Viral pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Fungal pneumonia. <br>
        Bacterial Pneumonia is caused by bacteria and might just affect one small area of your lung, or it may encompass all of both of your lungs. <br>
        Viral Pneumonia is responsible for about one-third of all pneumonia cases, and is caused by various viruses typically goes away more quickly. <br>
        Mycoplasma pneumonia is also known as walking pneumonia causes milder illness and is prominent in young adults. <br>
        Fungal pneumonia generally affects people with weak immune systems, including those with AIDS.
    </p>

    <u><h2><mark class="internal">Symptoms:</mark></h2></u>
    <ul>
        <li>Chest pain when you breathe or cough.</li>
        <li>Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older)</li>
        <li>Cough, which may produce phlegm.</li>
        <li>Fatigue.</li>
        <li>Fever, sweating and shaking chills.</li>
        <li>Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems)</li>
        <li>Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.</li>

    <u><h2><mark class="internal">Precautions & Preventions:</mark></h2></u>
    <ul>
        <li>Get a flu shot. Flu is a common cause of pneumonia, so one of the best defenses against contracting pneumonia is to get a flu shot each year.</li>
        <li>If you are prone to high risk, get vaccinated. </li>
        <li>Wash your hands regularly.</li>
        <li>Maintain healthy habits.</li>
        <li>Limit exposure to throat irritants, including pollution and alcohol</li>

    <u><h2><mark class="internal">Overview:</mark></h2></u>
    <p> It is also called as Diabetes Mellitus and refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar (glucose). <br>
        Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and tissues. <br>
         It's also the brain's main source of fuel.<br>
         no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in the blood. <br>
         Too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p> Diabetes comes in different forms, depending on the cause.<br>
        Prediabetes- It is when your blood sugar is higher than it should be but not high enough for your doctor to diagnose diabetes.<br>
        Type 1 diabetes- It is also called insulin-dependent diabetes and is an autoimmune condition. It happens when your body attacks your pancreas with antibodies. <br>
        The organ is damaged and doesn't make insulin. <br>
        Type 2 Diabetes- Here, your pancreas usually creates some insulin. But either it’s not enough or your body doesn’t use it like it should.<br>
        Type 2 diabetes is often milder than type 1 <br>
        Gestational Diabetes- Pregnancy usually causes some form of insulin resistance. If this becomes diabetes, it’s called gestational. <br>
        Gestational diabetes is more of a risk for the baby than the mother. <br>
        A baby might have unusual weight gain before birth, trouble breathing at birth, or a higher risk of obesity and diabetes later in life.
